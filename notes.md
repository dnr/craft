# craft — code review tool

- goal: use github code review without using the awful github ui
- idea is to make it editor-agnostic, code review state is represented explicitly in file(s)
- code under review is locally navigable, buildable, testable
- github code review comments appear as special comments in the code
- there can be editor integration to easily create new comments, reply to
  existing ones, approve, etc.
- this means the local files won't match the branch exactly, and the line number will be off
  - Q: is that going to cause any problems?
- general flow
  - `craft get [<pr#>]`
    - assume we're already in a git repo with github as a remote
    - pulls head of PR branch into a local branch named for pr number (if already on a branch, can use just `get` to pull latest changes)
    - switches to that branch (abort if local changes)
    - gets inline PR comments, integrates them into comments in the code
    - gets general PR comments, puts in PRMETA in repo root (along with sufficient metadata to send the review)
  - user: opens files in vim, use fugitive difftool/diffsplit, add new comments
  - `craft send`
    - loads PRMETA, and loads all review comments from source files
    - figures out what api calls to make to send everything
    - prints out what will be sent
    - if given `--go`, sends it
    - saves new meta to PRMETA if necessary
- decisions made
  - **API**: GitHub REST API (more stable/documented than GraphQL)
  - **Language**: Go (easier static binaries, good GitHub API support)
  - **Comment format**: Use `⦒` as delimiter, e.g. `// ⦒ content goes here`
    - Still valid language comments, but visually distinctive
    - Content after `⦒` can use prefixes to distinguish types:
      - Comment headers, bodies, new comments to submit, approve/reject directives
    - Avoids conflicts with existing code using fancy unicode
- references
